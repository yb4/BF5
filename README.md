# Homelessness in the United States
This assignment visualizes data from multiple sources and allows audience to draw a relation between Increasing rent price and Wage Increase and people moving out of Neighbourhoods and correlation between increase in use of Drug and Alocohol Usage and Increase in Homelessness. This topic is very essential to Seattle since with the heavy increase in growth of Startups around the region, many locals have been forced to relocate and a lot of neighbourhoods in Seattle have shown major signs of being Gentrified.

# Why Homelessness?
Homelessness is a rising problem in Tech Hubs like Seattle, San Francisco, Austin - Texas and Boston - MA, wherein, due to rising costs of living because of an inorganic inflow of money from Tech Giants, costs of living start rising which eventually force people to move out to other places. Sometimes, the situation becomes so bad that people can't afford rent and made to live out on streets/ homeless shelters/ other forms of Refuge which qualify to be homeless according to this data set. We even explore what are sometimes referred to as causes of Homelessness too, like alcohol and drug abuse and demostrate if it holds true in case of all states.

# How does this Visualization Help?
This visualization, even though it is on a very small scale, can help government gain leverage over the problem of homelessness by attacking its root cause. Weather it is providing affordable housing schemes in very expensive states/neighbourhoods to making the laws more stringent on preventing alochol abuse to prevent homelessness, we go over differnt visualizations to see if any of these can be a potential causes of Homelessness

__There is also a static visualization that we created using code of R on the presentation on Slide 6__
